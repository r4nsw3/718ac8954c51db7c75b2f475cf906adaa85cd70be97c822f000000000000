  |   Cause distress in this fast-paced, challenging action platformer!     |
  |   Speed through dozens of missions as Special Agent Damsel, the first   |
  |   and last line of defense against the seedy world of corporate         |
  |   vampires. Rescue hostages, disarm bombs, hack servers and dispatch    |
  |   the undead with precision, speed, and style. Balance frenetic         |
  |   action with split-second choices, and pay attention, you never know   |
  |   where the next vamp will come from.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Enter a fully realised comic book world and help Damsel take on Red   |
  |   Mist, the powerful vampire corporation that's adding a new (and       |
  |   illegal) ingredient to their popular vampire drink. Uncover the       |
  |   secrets of the new recipe and stop the corporation from achieving     |
  |   their ultimate plan, the total dominance of vampires on Earth!        |

  |   "Use Damsel's powerful ultraviolet shotgun, quick reflexes,           |
  |   devastating melee, and lightning fast dash to string together         |
  |   stylish attacks. Tight and responsive controls let you move around    |
  |   each arena while avoiding the deadly hazards fiendishly placed to     |
  |   stop you in your tracks. Experiment with each mission to discover     |
  |   that perfect sequence of moves and attacks that maximise your         |
  |   effectiveness. Master Damsel's speed and precision to carve the       |
  |   perfect path through each arena, with every move counting toward      |
  |   that perfect score and a place at the top of the leaderboards.        |
  |   Damsel is a ballet, and you're the choreographer. ".                  |
